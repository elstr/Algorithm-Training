 ## JS Set Object
Lets you store unique values of any type and is much more easier to work with than an array for this specific case.

### Methods
* Set.prototype.add(value)
Appends a new element with the given value to the Set object. Returns the Set object.

* Set.prototype.delete(value)
Removes the element associated to the value and returns the value that Set.prototype.has(value) would have previously returned. 

* Set.prototype.has(value)
Returns a boolean asserting whether an element is present with the given value in the Set object or not.
