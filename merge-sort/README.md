# Merge Sort
- Divides the diven array into two halves: left & right.
- Calls mergeSort on these sub arrays.
- Once we get to arrays that are less than 2 in length, we begin to stitch them back together. 
- We sort as we stitch them up, thus leading to our sorted array by the time we're all the way back up the stack.
